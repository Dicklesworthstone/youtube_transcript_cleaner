Thanks for your interest in my open-source project! I hope you find it useful. You might also find my commercial web apps useful, and I would really appreciate it if you checked them out:

**[YoutubeTranscriptOptimizer.com](https://youtubetranscriptoptimizer.com)** makes it really quick and easy to paste in a YouTube video URL and have it automatically generate not just a really accurate direct transcription, but also a super polished and beautifully formatted written document that can be used independently of the video.

The document basically sticks to the same material as discussed in the video, but it sounds much more like a real piece of writing and not just a transcript. It also lets you optionally generate quizzes based on the contents of the document, which can be either multiple choice or short-answer quizzes, and the multiple choice quizzes get turned into interactive HTML files that can be hosted and easily shared, where you can actually take the quiz and it will grade your answers and score the quiz for you.

**[FixMyDocuments.com](https://fixmydocuments.com/)** lets you submit any kind of document— PDFs (including scanned PDFs that require OCR), MS Word and Powerpoint files, images, audio files (mp3, m4a, etc.) —and turn them into highly optimized versions in nice markdown formatting, from which HTML and PDF versions are automatically generated. Once converted, you can also edit them directly in the site using the built-in markdown editor, where it saves a running revision history and regenerates the PDF/HTML versions.

In addition to just getting the optimized version of the document, you can also generate many other kinds of "derived documents" from the original: interactive multiple-choice quizzes that you can actually take and get graded on; slick looking presentation slides as PDF or HTML (using LaTeX and Reveal.js), an in-depth summary, a concept mind map (using Mermaid diagrams) and outline, custom lesson plans where you can select your target audience, a readability analysis and grade-level versions of your original document (good for simplifying concepts for students), Anki Flashcards that you can import directly into the Anki app or use on the site in a nice interface, and more.
